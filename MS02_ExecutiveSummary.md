# Development methodology

The project includes the definition of numerous properties and generators for evaluating a scheduling approach for aircraft takeoff and landing on runways.

- Imports necessary classes and generators. Defines generators for Runway and Agenda objects. Provides a property-based test to check if the resulting Agenda object has non-empty lists of Aircraft and Runway objects.

- Defines generators for random Aircraft instances. Implements a property-based test to check if the ClassType of created Aircraft instances matches one of the ClassType values defined in Runway instances.

- Defines a generator for random Runway objects. Implements a property-based test to check if the created Runway object has a non-empty list of runway classes.

- Defines attributes used to validate a scheduling method. Specifies various properties to test the scheduling method. Uses helper functions from other files to generate random instances of runways, planes, and agendas.

- AttributeGenerator defines generators for various attributes used in the properties. For example, genIdentifier generates an Identifier type, genClassType generates a ClassType type, genAircraftTarget and genAircraftTime generate NonNegativeInteger types, and genAircraftEmergency generates an optional PositiveInteger type. genClassRunway generates a list of ClassType types by using the genClassType function.

These properties and generators are used together with a property testing library such as ScalaCheck to produce and validate inputs for the specified properties.

## Properties

### AgendaProperties
It imports necessary `Runway` and `Aircraft` classes and generators from other property suites.

- The `AgendaProperties` object defines a `Runway` object generator and an `Agenda` object generator.The `genAgenda` generator generates an `Agenda` object from a list of `Aircraft` objects ordered by goal integer value.

- The property method specifies a property-based test that determines whether the resulting `Agenda` object has non-empty lists of `Aircraft` and `Runway` objects. The forAll function does the test using a large number of randomly generated inputs.

### AircraftProperties
- The `genAircraft` method generates random `Aircraft` instances by using generators for its characteristics such as Identifier, ClassType, NonNegativeInteger, and Option[AircraftEmergency].

- The property function defines a property-based test that determines whether the ClassType of the created `Aircraft` instances matches one of the ClassType values defined in the `Runway` instances.

- The forAll function is used to perform the test, which generates random `Runway` and `Aircraft` objects and validates the property for each combination. The produced `Aircraft` instance for each test case is included in the test output.

### RunwaysProperties
- The `genRunway` function generates a random `Runway` object with a four-character identification and a set of runway classes.

- The property function implements a property-based test that determines whether the created `Runway` object has a list of runway classes that is not empty. 

- When the test is run, ScalaCheck will build many random `Runway` objects with the `genRunway` generator and see if the property is true for all of them. ScalaCheck will notice a failure and provide a counter example if the property for any created `Runway` object fails.

### ScheduleProperties

> In a valid schedule, every aircraft was assigned a runway

- The property test ensures that every aircraft is allotted a runway in every valid timetable. It accomplishes this by generating random sets of runways and aircrafts, using the schedule function to generate a schedule, and then ensuring that every aircraft in the original set gets allocated to a runway in the resultant schedule.

> Each aircraft should be scheduled for a runway which can handle it

- It generates random runway and aircraft agendas, then schedules the planes on the runways. Finally, it determines if all scheduled aircrafts are assigned to a runway capable of handling their class type.

> An aircraft can never be scheduled before its â€œtarget time

- It generates random scenarios of runways and aircrafts using the `genAgenda` generator, schedules the aircrafts on the runways beginning at time 0, and then verifies if all scheduled aircrafts have a target time that is less than or equal to their actual planned time. The test fails if any aircraft is scheduled before its planned time.

> An emergency aircraft should never exceed its allotted time

- It generates random runway and aircraft scenarios, schedules them, and checks to see if all emergency aircrafts in the schedule have a time that is less than or equal to their target time plus their allocated emergency time.

> Schedule the non-emergency aircraft in a 'first come, first served' manner

- It generates random runway and aircraft scenarios, then checks to see if the planned aircrafts are sorted by target time and arrival time, and if both lists are equal.

> Two or more aircraft on a runway should never be assigned simultaneous times

- This code defines a property that checks whether two or more aircraft on a runway are assigned simultaneous times. It generates test cases using a generator called ``genAgenda`` and then verifies that the scheduled aircrafts on the runways do not have overlapping times.

## Generators

### AttributeGenerator

- The `genIdentifier` function generates an Identifier type by constructing an Identifier from a string of alphanumeric characters of a certain length. If the construction fails, so will the generator.

- The `genClassType` method creates a ClassType type by selecting a random byte value from a given range and attempting to construct a ClassType from that value. If the construction fails, so will the generator.

- The `genAircraftTarget` and `genAircraftTime` functions build NonNegativeInteger types by selecting a random integer value within a certain range and attempting to construct a NonNegativeInteger from it. If the construction fails, so will the generator.

- By selecting a random positive integer value and attempting to construct a PositiveInteger from that value, the `genAircraftEmergency` function generates an optional PositiveInteger type. If the construction fails, so will the generator. The PositiveInteger that results is then wrapped in an Option. 

- The `genClassRunway` method generates a list of ClassType types by selecting a random length for the list and then using the `genClassType` function to generate that many ClassType values.
