# Aircraft Scheduling Problem (ASP)

The Aircraft Scheduling Problem (ASP) involves a set of aircraft that are preparing to take off or land at an airport.
Each aircraft belongs to a size and weight class and has a target takeoff or landing time within a time window.

The challenge is to assign a runway and takeoff or landing time for each aircraft, considering separation requirements
that depend on the sequence of previous and subsequent operations, as well as the type of operation and class of aircraft
involved.

Delays incur penalty costs, which vary according to the type of operation, class of aircraft and duration of delay.

The Objective is Assign runways and times to aircraft for take-offs and landings while meeting sequence-dependent
separation requirements and minimizing delays costs. Runways may have specific usage restrictions and schedules
for interdependent runways require diagonal separation constraints.
